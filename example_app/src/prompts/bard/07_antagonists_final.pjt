Ok, your first draft to put together for antagonist landscape is looking pretty good. But I do have some feedback and I hope that you are willing to take some critical suggestions.



{{ input }}


{% if human_input %}

  But my most important advice, is this.  Please pay close attention:

  {{ human_input }}

{% endif %}

With those thoughts in mind, I wonder if you would be willing to give me another attempt at that same antagonist strategy. I think a lot of the main ideas you had are great, but do you think you could give me the whole antagonist, supporting characters, the twist for revealing the real nature to the protagonists, as well as the ways that the protagonists might individually identify or be tempted by the antagonists' true nature?
