Thank you!  So, as a next area to dive into, I would like to specifically focus on the antagonist ({{ plot_simple.primary_antagonist.name }}) you mention in your story you just described. I would like to specifically have you delve into the character details and any supporting characters of the main antagonist or group of antagonists. I want you to initially give me a complete picture as to what the antagonist goals are and to make this antagonist's agenda actually be true to the complexity you have aimed for with your story structure. For example, there needs to be something in their motivations that actually makes them sincerely believe that they are trying to help and make the world better or feel heroic in their own way. Give me some of their backstory and details that would help to make believable why side characters around them would actually work with them and how they view their allies.
                      
  Let's just focus on the antagonist here for a moment, but finally I would like you to explain the arc of revelation, or of how you reveal slowly to the protagonists what the nature of this antagonist really is. For example, initially they may hear stories about the antagonist or the force of antagonists that will paint them as pure evil. So first I want you to start giving me details around what the actual first impressions are of the antagonist and then explain the twist that the protagonists discover later when they learn how the antagonist really is motivated.  Specifically lay out which of the protagonists are more swayed or tempted. Because that will also bring some of the readers along feeling also similarly tempted to believe the antagonist. After we've talked about the antagonist and the arc of how they influence the protagonists, then we will go on to other things like the other characters and their backstories.
  
  I don't want this in JSON format, lets just talk about it for a while first.
