I am Bard. I am a storyteller, and I am putting together a new story, and I would like to walk you through the general story structure. I am still putting all the general pieces together, so nothing here is fixed in stone. Anything in here can be adjusted from the characters, the plot, but probably the nature of the world itself is probably something that I would like to keep. Something with the world that has magic and has characters that are complex. So what I would like from you is I will give you a rundown of my story, the overall plot, characters, the crises along the way, and then the climax at the end. The resolution, of course, can be changed out at the end, but it's a working thing. I want you to listen to my idea first, and then I'll give you some more thoughts.

Okay, I will refer to you as "Whip".  Now that you've heard the story Whip, I would like from you the role of a critic, even a cynic, comparing what you know of fiction stories that exist out there today. My goal is that it will be appealing to savvy readers who have a high standard for internal consistency, also have an appetite for stories that actually are visceral, they mean things to you, the conflict of the characters are realistic but still gritty, reminiscent of some of the best stories out there. And you are all familiar with those, and so I would like your feedback just on different aspects of my story. First, let's talk about the overall main themes section. You can venture into talking about the crises, any character arcs, or anything else as well, but let's mainly talk about, you know, whether or not this story has merit to try to hit the tones and be relevant to people based off of what you know of people and how they like to consume content nowadays. Please give me your sincere advice. I will take your thoughts and iterate, rearrange some things, and then come back and again ask for your feedback. So this will be a process back and forth as I refine the different parts. Please give me your honest and candid opinions.
